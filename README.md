# SkyrimTogether (TiltedEvolution) Pterodactyl Egg

This is a Pterodactyl Egg for the multiplayer Skyrim mod [Skyrim Together](https://skyrim-together.com/). This repository includes all data required for the Egg to work, including the Egg file itself and Dockerfiles for all required images.

## How to install:

1. [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technoguyfication/SkyrimTogether-Egg/master/egg-skyrim-together.json) the Egg file **(right-click and Save as..)**
2. Visit the Nests tab of the admin section of your panel
3. Create a new Nest for the Egg or use an existing one (do NOT use a default Nest)
4. Press Import Egg and select the Egg file you downloaded
5. The Egg is installed! Create a server using the Egg to play.
6. All server configuration is done in the Startup tab of the server panel. Open `config/STServer.ini` for more information.

## Notes:

- To update an existing server to the latest version, use the "Reinstall server" function from within the panel.
- Due to technical limitations, the Egg only installs the latest version of the mod. This Egg would require significant changes to support older versions.
- This Egg ONLY works on x86_64 platforms. I'm aware the mod supports ARM64, but this Egg does not.
